# TEN7 Employee Handbook

Hello, we're [TEN7](https://ten7.com/) and this is our official [employee handbook](https://handbook.ten7.com/). If you're a new team member, grab a cup of your favorite beverage and [read it](https://handbook.ten7.com/).

## Format

The handbook is a simple static site that's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [Github](https://pages.github.com/) and uses the [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme. All pages are markdown files that we [track changes](https://github.com/ten7/handbook.ten7.com) to and do [releases](https://github.com/ten7/handbook.ten7.com/releases/) of, just like any of our sites.

There are eight sections to the handbook, each section is a Markdown file whose name is prepended by a three-digit number. For example, the first page is `010-welcome.md` and contains the Welcome message. If you'd like to add pages inbetween existing sections, just prepend with a number that sorts accordingly. You could add a page after `010-welcome.md` by naming it `015-newpage.md`.
