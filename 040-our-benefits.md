## OUR BENEFITS

Taking care of our employees is a top priority for us. Here’s a list of TEN7 benefits we’re
excited to offer.

### Health, Dental and Vision Insurance

Your coverage goes into effect on the first day of the first month after you start at TEN7. For example, if you start on January 14th, your coverage starts February 1st. Our team is located across the country, so we’ve chosen nationwide carriers that have coverage in the state in which you reside.

#### Health

For health coverage, you can either participate in TEN7’s pre-tax group health insurance plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota (even if you don’t live in MN), or you can choose your own coverage on the Individual health insurance market, with a post-tax stipend that can be put towards coverage of your choice.

Choose either
**TEN7’s Group Health Insurance**
TEN7 covers 100% of your monthly premium, and when selecting Group Health, you have the option to choose one of two available plans:

* **Health Savings Account (HSA) Option**<br/>
[BlueAccess HSA Silver $4000 Plan 645](2019_BlueAccess_HSA_Silver_$4000_Plan_645_M00649R01_508.pdf)
    * If you proceed with the HSA plan, TEN7 will send you a link to [Lively](https://livelyme.com/) to set up HSA contributions, which are deducted from each paycheck. 
* **PPO Option**<br/>
[BlueAccess GOLD $1000 Plan 637](2019_BlueAccess_Gold_$1000_Plan_637_M00640R01_508.pdf)

or

**Individual Coverage**<br/>
TEN7 provides a stipend of up to $450 per month, on a post-tax basis. You buy healthcare coverage on the individual market through our partner, [Gravie](http://gravie.com/). 

Not sure which coverage makes sense for your healthcare needs? TEN7 offers [Gravie’s concierge services](https://www.gravie.com/) to all employees to help you figure it out. Please call them, they’re awesome!

#### Dental

100% of your monthly premium for group dental coverage through Delta Dental of Minnesota’s Delta Dental PPO Plus Premier plan is covered by TEN7.

#### Vision

Group vision coverage on the [Premier Enhanced Plan](https://www.bluecrossmn.com/healthy/public/portalcomponents/PublicContentServlet?contentId=P11GA_16223992) through Blue Cross Blue Shield of MN is paid for 100% by TEN7.

### Holidays

We offer the following days as paid holidays to enjoy time with family and friends:

* New Year’s Eve
* Memorial Day
* Independence Day
* Labor Day
* Thanksgiving Day
* Day after Thanksgiving Day
* Christmas Eve
* Christmas
* New Year’s Day

### Paid Time Off (PTO)

PTO is time for rest, travel and stepping away from your computer. Upon hire, you’ll accrue paid time off at a rate of 0.25 days per week worked, which is equivalent to 13 days annually.

* You may use PTO for vacation, personal days and sick days.
* If you need more paid time off than you’ve earned, it’s okay for you to take a few days in advance of earning them, as long as it’s approved beforehand.
* PTO increases are reviewed annually.
* PTO resets at the beginning of the calendar year (doesn’t roll over).

In addition to your PTO days, you have two paid days off annually to use for professional development. You can find additional details about this in the Professional Development section of this handbook.

#### Planning for Time Off

When you need to take time off, communicate with your teammates to make sure nothing slips through the cracks while you’re out.

To request time off, you will log in to your Gusto account and enter the dates needed for PTO. Once you receive an email that your request has been approved, please set up a calendar invite and invite Hermie (hermie@ten7.com) so everyone else knows you are out. 

If you need to edit or delete your PTO request, adjust the Gusto request and the calendar invite.

Visit the following confluence page for the step-by-step process to [request PTO](https://teamten7.atlassian.net/wiki/x/6wDx). 

#### Logging PTO in JIRA

Log your PTO time using issue [T7IN-12](https://teamten7.atlassian.net/browse/T7IN-12).

### Parental Leave

As a new parent, it’s important that you have time to spend with the new addition to your family. That’s why all new parents who’ve worked at TEN7 for six months may take two weeks paid parental leave. You may then use accumulated PTO and Short Term Disability for additional paid time off, up to 12 weeks. How you schedule the two weeks around the birth is up to you.

### Sabbatical

We’re excited to offer paid sabbatical leave to long-term TEN7 employees. After you’ve been working at TEN7 for four years, you can take a four-week paid sabbatical during your fifth year of employment. We encourage you to take this time to go on an adventure, follow a passion, or work on a creative project—just grow and rejuvenate. This benefit repeats for every four years that you’re an employee. Listen to our podcast on [Employee Sabbaticals](https://ten7.com/blog/post/episode-016-employee-sabbaticals-and-why-ten7-offers-them) to learn more.

### Bereavement

In the unfortunate event that you experience the loss of a family member or friend, TEN7 will pay for up to three days of leave.

### Jury Duty

If you’re called to serve on a jury, you’ll receive your full pay for up to five days while you’re serving. However, if jury duty runs longer than five days, TEN7 won’t cover your pay starting on the sixth business day of jury duty.

### 401(k)

Upon hire, you can opt in to our 401(k) plan that has a 4% match, and no vesting period. You can also [roll over funds](https://success.guideline.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007550292-Rollover-other-accounts-into-your-Guideline-401-k-) from other eligible accounts. When determining your 401(k) contribution amount, take into account what you’ve contributed during the calendar year so far, so you don’t go over the IRS contribution maximum.

[Guideline](https://www.guideline.com/) can help you with 401(k) issues as well.

### Life Insurance

You’ll receive SmartChoice Life and Accidental Death & Dismemberment coverage for up to $50,000 from Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company. 

You may purchase additional coverage up to $200,000 at your own expense.

### Short-Term Disability

You’ll also receive SmartChoice Short Term Disability coverage from Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company. The plan provides 60% of your earnings, up to a $7,500 maximum monthly benefit.

### Additional Discounts

Through Principal Life Insurance, TEN7 offers discounts on laser vision correction, a hearing aid program, will and legal document assistance, beneficiary support as well as a few others. See the [Additional Discount](TEN7-Principal-Ins-Co-Additional-Benefits.pdf) document for details.

Please note: these services are independent of TEN7 healthcare benefits and any costs incurred will not count towards the annual deductible. However, it may be possible to use HSA funds towards the medical procedures. Check out the [current HSA eligibility policy](https://livelyme.com/whats-eligible/) for details.

### Professional Development

TEN7 encourages employees to keep learning and growing professionally. You'll receive a $1,500 annual stipend, plus two additional paid days off to use towards a conference or an educational experience of your choosing (including books).
* Visit the following Confluence page for step-by-step process to [request time off for Professional Development](https://teamten7.atlassian.net/wiki/x/6wDx). 

### Technology Stipend

As a distributed agency, we know how important it is to have reliable technology. We expect you to have current and working equipment so you’re able to effectively do your job.

We give you an annual $1,500 stipend to use towards technology or work-related services that best suits your needs. The stipend will be deposited on your [PEX](https://www.pexcard.com/) card on a monthly basis, beginning the first full month following your hire date. Please note:

* The equipment or service you buy must be wholly funded by the stipend (i.e. you can’t use a $1,500 stipend towards a $3,000 computer).
* If you’re a new employee, you may advance ahead on the stipend to purchase a major piece of equipment.
* If you use your stipend towards a major piece of equipment like a computer or mobile phone, it will be the property of TEN7 for two years. After that time, you can buy the equipment from TEN7 for $1.
* If you’re going to use a computer you already own for TEN7 work, you can use the stipend for other technology or work-related things.

Examples of appropriate uses of the stipend:

* Computer, tablet, monitor or phone
* External hard drive, keyboard, mouse, microphone, headset
* Setting up your home office (buying furniture, etc.)
* Internet service, cell phone service

TEN7 covers the cost for required software and tools, such as licenses for PHPStorm, the Adobe suite of products, JIRA, etc.

### Carbon Offset

TEN7 cares about our environment. To that end, we purchase an [Employee Renewable Energy Bundle](http://store.b-e-f.org/products/employee-renewable-energy-bundle/) and an [Employee Water Bundle](http://store.b-e-f.org/products/employee-water-bundle/) for every team member. Each quarter, you will receive a Renewable Energy Certificate and a Water Restoration Certificate, and each will note the details of the energy or water program that benefits from the offset.

* Listen to our podcast [episode #53](https://ten7.com/blog/post/episode-053-heather-schrock-bonneville-environmental-foundation) where Ivan interviews the BEF representative who manages our certificates to learn more.
