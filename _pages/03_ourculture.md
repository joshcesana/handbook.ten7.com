We’re proud of our values. We try to live and breathe them daily. We incorporate them into our work and communication with each other and our clients. They’re our foundation.

## Our mission

Make Things That Matter. 

## Our vision

TEN7 is a place where our team, our partners and our customers do the best work of their lives.

## Our values

### Be honest

We speak as candidly, openly, and honestly as possible. We endeavor to be empathetic and connect with those around us. By speaking plainly, we can encourage clear and honest communication. We aspire to start from a position of trust, rather than fear; humility, rather than arrogance; and respect, rather than wariness.

### Be inclusive

We recognize that our collective differences make us stronger. Our openness and diversity of ideas and backgrounds allows us to think more widely, cover more ground, and provide stronger solutions that matter to a larger audience. We hope to remain open minded, collecting diverse ideas and perspectives before synthesizing, editing, adapting, and focusing our ideas. More importantly, we seek our common humanity, which allows us to connect and collaborate together.

### Be open

By working in the light, we tend to write better code, create better business practices, and be more equitable with one another. Thus, openness and transparency make us stronger and provide patterns and solutions that others can build on. We choose to be open by default. We opt for transparency. Sharing is an act of gratitude and tends to perpetuate that act. Open is inclusive. Open encourages trust. Open is good.

### Be mindful

Choose to be present, curious, and vulnerable. We want to create a culture where it is safe to be vulnerable, and admit your difficulties, differences, and confusion so that we may learn from one another and become better together. Choose to listen. Try to hear others’ perspectives and ideas. It is easy to close ourselves off from one another, but we want everyone to have a voice. We need to hear one another and stay present with our ideas. Ideas are important. Intention is important. Your voice is important.

### Be a team

We recognize that our collective effort is more than just the sum of its parts. By sharing our ideas, learning from one another, and supporting one another, we become stronger both individually and collectively. By opting for trust first, we try not to create an “us” and “them” atmosphere. By opting for openness first, we want to encourage collaboration in all things. It is our goal to empower not only our clients, but each other as well – so that we can be the best we can be and take pride in creating amazing work for our clients.

## Above the Line/Below the Line

As you heard in the “Know Yourself First” video, TEN7 is proponent of above the line and below the line behaviors. The line represents the threshold between laudable behavior ("above the line") and harmful behavior ("below the line").

It’s everyone’s duty to keep an eye out and hold each other accountable to these behaviors. When you observe behavior that’s above or below the imaginary line that our values define, you should say something, whether in person, via email, or in Slack. Here are some examples of behaviors that are above and below the line:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Acknowledge Mistakes<br/>"My Mistake!"</td>
<td>Teach Each Other</td>
<td>Ask for Help</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Collective Success</td>
<td>Perseverance</td>
<td>"Ok—Let's do that"<br/>Getting others to consider advice</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"That's not my fault"</td>
<td>Not asking for help</td>
<td>Whining</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not taking the time to help someone understand</td>
<td>Avoiding Ownership</td>
<td>Hoarding Knowledge</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### DiSC Assessment

If you’re not familiar with the DiSC personality profile tool, you’re about to be! It’s another part of the foundation of TEN7. We have every team member take the assessment. You’ll find out where you are on the DiSC model and how this depicts your work style. You’ll also find out where other TEN7 team members are on the DiSC profile, so you’ll learn how to better understand and collaborate with your team members.

TEN7 first went through the DiSC assessment for the entire team in 2016, and it’s really helped us iterate our processes and resolve team issues and pain points.

The DiSC sorts people into four behavioral profiles. Can you guess what area best applies to you?

### TEN7 Blueprint for Operations

We've worked hard to create and refine an efficient, thorough and rigorous software development process at TEN7. We’re documenting our philosophy and procedures in a document, “The TEN7 Blueprint for Operations.” In the spirit of open source, we’re going to be releasing it for public consumption. Whether you're a developer or not, the Blueprint is worth a browse to see how even in software development, we pay attention to the people as much as the process.

### Who We Like to Work With

We like to work with nice people who have interesting problems for us to solve, especially complex integrations.
We also like to work with companies who work for social good. At the end of the day, we want our work to have a net positive impact. We want to leave the world a better place.
