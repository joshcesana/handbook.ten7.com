Hopefully by now you know we like you! We see you as a part of this team. Please ask us as many questions as you like. Make mistakes! We all make them—it’s how we learn and continually improve. Try new things and have them fail. And, please share your opinion! We thrive on learning from each other. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. We’re a close-knit team and work to support one another!

We’ve put together this handbook so you have the tools and knowledge to be set up for success and you can get to know us better.

## Your First Day's Duties

Your first day at TEN7 is easy: set up your computer, read this handbook, read a few articles and watch some videos—that’s it!

We’ve put all the tasks you need to do on the First Day Checklist.

## Meet Your Buddy

We believe in the importance of mentoring, especially when you’re new! During your first week, you’ll be paired with a peer who will show you the ropes, and check in with you to make sure you’ve got all the information you need to settle in. They’ll also be the person with whom you’ll share success stories as you get going.

## Break the Ice

As a way to get to know each other, how about a few icebreaker questions? We use a service from [Know Your Team](https://knowyourteam.com/) to help us. It’s how we keep learning about each other, even though we’re distributed. You’ll receive an email from the service with instructions—don’t worry, it’s easy! And once you’ve answered the five questions, your answers will be shared with the team. You’ll receive a copy of what everyone else answered when they started too.

Additionally, Know Your Team sends out a company question every Wednesday, and a social question on Friday. Each person’s answers are shared the following workday. We think it helps us keep a pulse on our culture. We take employee submissions for questions too—just send them to [hr@ten7.com](mailto:hr@ten7.com).
