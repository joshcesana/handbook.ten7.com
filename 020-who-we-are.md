## Who We Are
TEN7 is a full-service interactive strategy and web development firm focusing on Drupal. We create and care for Drupal-powered websites. But we are so much more than that! TEN7 is a team of hard-working, brilliant, kind individuals who wake up each morning striving to do our best.

We ask for help, we ask questions and we challenge each other.

We know how important it is to be nice.

We believe that by working together, we can accomplish incredible things.

We asked our team to share what they would go back and tell themselves as a new hire at TEN7. Here is what a few of us said:

* Be confident, you know more than you think you do.
* Don’t stress too hard about everything being perfect.
* Don’t be afraid to ask for help. We’re a team and everyone really does want to help!
* The TEN7 team is open and we want to hear what you have to say.

Watch our session [Know Yourself First](http://2016.tcdrupal.org/session/know-yourself-first-how-it-took-us-8-years-figure-it-out) from Twin Cities Drupal Camp 2016 to learn more about our team and how we realized it was important to know ourselves first before we could succeed in our work.

### Our Company and Product Names

We're a small company, so all of us are brand ambassadors for TEN7. Since you might be writing about our company and products, here are the rules. 

#### Writing Our Company Name

You can write our company's name in many different ways—but there are a few that are preferred over others.
It's correct to write:

* TEN7
* T7 (for short)
* But mentions of the website are in lowercase (ten7.com)

The rule of thumb is that "TEN7" should always be written in CAPS with NO space between the "TEN" and the number "7"—please don’t use lower case, and don’t add spaces. The "TEN7" wordmark is geared to resemble the logo as closely as possible.

Exception: Our company’s legal name is **Ten 7 Interactive, LLC**., but this will only be used on legal documents like signed contracts. Ivan talks about our company’s origin in episode 21 of our podcast [“TEN7’s Origins.”](https://ten7.com/blog/post/episode-021-ten7s-origins)

#### Writing Our Product Names

TEN7 has a growing family of products and services.
* Products with "TEN7" in the name do not have a space in them. Examples are TEN7Audit, TEN7Improve, and TEN7Care.
* Products are written in normal style (no bolding or italics).

### Our Type

Our official font is Adrianna by [Chank Diesel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chank_Diesel), a Minneapolis type designer. The font was selected by [Aaron Draplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Draplin), who designed our logo. Please [download the font](https://t7.io/adrianna) from TEN7’s Google Drive and install it onto your computer. You will need to log in with your TEN7 G Suite account.

### Our Template

When you start a new document in Google Docs, please use [the TEN7 template](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?ftv=1&tgif=d). It’s preset with styles for H1, H2, H3 that closely match our branding. Note: Adrianna is not a font available in G Suite so we use Montserrat.
